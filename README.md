# Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to identify patterns and trends related to gender, test preparation, lunch type, and score distribution. The analysis is performed using Python and basic data analytics libraries.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Students Performance in Exams  
- The dataset contains exam scores of 1000 students along with demographic and preparation-related information.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data loading and exploration (`head`, `shape`, `info`)
- Average score analysis across subjects
- Group-wise analysis by gender, test preparation, and lunch type
- Visualization using bar charts and histograms
- Interpretation of results through written insights

## 📈 Key Insights
- Female students scored slightly higher than male students in math on average.
- Students who completed test preparation courses performed better across all subjects.
- Math scores are mostly concentrated in the mid-range with fewer extreme values.

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `student_performance_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with analysis and visualizations  
- `StudentsPerformance.csv` – Dataset used for analysis

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand the basic workflow of a data analytics project, including data exploration, analysis, visualization, and insight generation.
